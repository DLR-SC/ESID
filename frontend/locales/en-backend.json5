    tooltip: 'The numbers of infected and hospitalised shown here are based on assumptions about immunity, duration and\
              severity of infection with Sars-CoV-2. They are calculated via a complex multi-step process from the\
              reported case numbers and a simple formula cannot be given. An increase/decrease in the number of cases\
              means an increase/decrease in the number of infected persons, so that it is possible to assess whether\
              the situation is improving or worsening in relation to the values of the previous days. If available, the\
              figures on intensive care patients come from the DIVI Intensive Care Register.',
